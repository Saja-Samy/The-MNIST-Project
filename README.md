Project Flow:
1- Load the dataset and explore its structure and contents. /n
2- Apply feature selection techniques to identify the most relevant features. \n
3- Build machine learning models using the selected features.
4- Evaluate the performance of the models on a separate test set.
5- Fine-tune the hyperparameters of the best-performing models.
