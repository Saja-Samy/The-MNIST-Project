# The-MNIST-Project<br>
<br>
MNIST, a (famous) handwritten digits database. It was developed by Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes and Christopher Burges for evaluating ML models on capability to recognize handwritten digits. The dataset was constructed from a number of scanned document datasets available from the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST - M stands for Modified). <br>
<br>
Images of digits were taken from a variety of scanned documents, normalized in size and centered. Each image is a 28 Ã— 28 pixel square (784 pixels total). There are 10 digits (0 to 9) or 10 classes to predict. <br>
<br>

Project Flow:
1- Load the dataset and explore its structure and contents. 
2- Apply feature selection techniques to identify the most relevant features. 
3- Build machine learning models using the selected features.
4- Evaluate the performance of the models on a separate test set.
5- Fine-tune the hyperparameters of the best-performing models.
